# Kommunikeer

Kommunikeer is an Afrikaans word meaning “to communicate.” It represents the core idea behind this project — enabling effortless communication across languages.

Kommunikeer is an application that allows students, professionals, and creators to share their presentations, videos, and conferences in any language. We handle the streaming, translation, and distribution — so your audience can experience your content in real time, regardless of their native tongue.

Forget about preparing multiple versions of the same presentation. Kommunikeer translates both spoken and visual elements from your stream, making your content universally accessible and truly global.
